/** This class does simple one level mime parsing to find crypto
  data.

  Use the mimedataprovider on a body or attachment stream. It
  will do the conversion from MIME to PGP / CMS data on the fly.
  Similarly when writing it will split up the data into a body /
  html body and attachments.

  A detached signature will be made available through the
  signature function.

  When reading the raw mime data from the underlying stream is
  "collected" and parsed into crypto data which is then
  buffered in an internal gpgme data stucture.

  For historicial reasons this class both provides reading
  and writing to be able to reuse the same mimeparser code.
  Similarly using the C-Style parsing code is for historic
  reason because as this class was created to have a data
  container unrelated of the Outlook Object model (after
  creation) the mimeparser code already existed and was
  stable.
