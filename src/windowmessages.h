/** Window Message handling for GpgOL.
  In Outlook only one thread has access to the Outlook Object model
  and this is the UI Thread. We can work in other threads but
  to do something with outlooks data we neet to be in the UI Thread.
  So we create a hidden Window in this thread and use the fact
  that SendMessage handles Window messages in the thread where the
  Window was created.
  This way we can go back to interactct with the Outlook from another
  thread without working with COM Multithreading / Marshaling.

  The Responder Window should be initalized on startup.
